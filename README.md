## Welcome to my new repository.

I'm not too familiar with markdown but I can make some cool stuff, including but not limited to...
    - _Italics_
    - Bullets
    - And other stuff.
    
**I'm causing a unsynchronized commit on the master branch right now to break things so that I can answer a question in the lab report. It's pretty wild.**
