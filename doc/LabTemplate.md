# Sample ECE16 Lab Report
Prepared by: Edward Jay Wang

Date: 01/06/2020

## Tutorial:
In each lab, there will be a series of tutorials that aim to get everyone the needed information to tackle the challenge for each lab assignments. There are a series of discussion questions, labeled with a Q. and highlighted in red that you must answer in this lab report. These answers should be thought out and backed by your reasoning. Treat it the same way as you answer math questions. Expect that if you just write out the answer and don't show your work, you will not get full credit. 

For example, a question like this:

> Q. Describe the output you observe on the Serial Monitor

Sample answers 

> 1. **Not Good (no credit)**: Screenshot the output on the Serial Monitor with no explanation
>
> 2. **Acceptable (partial credit)**: Screenshot the output on the Serial Monitor. Simple description like, the Serial Monitor's output slows down when the strings being printed out get's larger. 
>
> 3. **Excellent (full credit)**: Screenshot the output on the Serial Monitor. Descriptive observation like, in the initial test at 9600 Baud Rate, the Serial Monitor had printouts every X ms. When the message was changed to double the length, each line was printed out at Y ms. This makes sense because the Baud Rate is equal to SOMETHING SOMETHING. As such, when we print out a message of z length, the time it takes to print equal u. 


When answering a Question, please include both the question and the answer, as such:

>Q. The question verbatim from the lab document

>A. Your excellent answer with whatever images and stuff.
>
>and if you need to skip a line, just keep adding > and you will have the same block. 

## Challenges:
In every lab assignment, there are 3 challenges. For each challenge, there will usually be an associated code to be submitted and a series of discussion questions. You are to answer the discussion questions here.

Including Screenshots, photos, and videos of you outputs and setup is also important as it helps contextualize what you are observing. For the most part, we only expect you to include screenshots and photos to augment your report. There will be a few challenges where we explicitly ask for videos. In those cases, please include videos. 

Divide each of challenge under a sub-sub-sub heading:

### Challenge 1: Name of Challenge
Provide a quick summary, in your own words what the challenge is about and how did you approach it. Same thing goes for this, be descriptive. And again use blocks to answer the questions in an organized fashion. 

>Q. First questions

>A. Your answer and supporting image
>
>To include an image, first include your image in your images folder.

### Challenge 2:
>Q. Second Challenge wants you to have a video!

>A. Answer the question and describe the video.
